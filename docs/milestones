Epic F plan

Milestone 1: 2 months - until 2020 May
  Have a functional and playable version of: 
	- ONE area with full combat(but basic, just weapons) ~10 rooms? Multiple branches though
	- ONE town with weapons/armor shop
	- Inventory and Equipment screens
	- Stats screen
	- Gold is everywhere - in main screen close to energy..
	- polished a bit, but not much
  Make it realistic- meaning, that 3/4 of this area CAN be completed via a week and 8-10 runs. ( We only have runs now to spend energy, nothing else ). The rest of the area can maybe be completed with hard grinding, but final boss probably not. Escape mechanics has to be very viable (maybe loose loot?)
  You can test it through easier with enhanced game timing
  This demo should be playable by testers (but should not take them that week - maybe a day? or maybe just few hours)

  You HAVE to have some feedback before continuing to milestone 2

Milestone 2: 4 months - until 2020 September
	- Experience/Level system - You get stats points when you level, and have to pick how to spend them?
	- A map with few towns and travel mechanics
        - 3-4 areas for each town
	- Very basic spells ( but no full system )
	- Very basic consumables ( again no system )
	- Spells/skills can be learned using game energy in few weeks real time ( maybe keep investing some of energy into skills )
		- Advanced learned Spells/skills should almost never be more powerful than basic, but let you easier run through some areas
	- polished quite a lot - maybe at top polishing notch, it would not get higher in alpha

	This is essentially THE BASIC GAME. You can choose which spells/skills to learn, but everything revolves around combat and clearing even more advanced areas.

	Again, show this to way more people, and polish it way more, this HAS to be enjoyable in the beginning, because it's the CORE game and would be the ONLY game for everyone starting. I wish to make this game mega deep, but if you do not get interested by the CORE, there's no hope
		
Milestone 3:  4 months until 2021 January
	- Missions system and starting story ( The story should be very advanced, just there should not be a lot of it )
	- Races/professions and reincarnation - THE BIGGEST IDEA of this game
	- Trading system
	- Multiplayer features ( chat, channels, parties )
	- more towns, more areas

Release of alpha is planned for 2022. I want this game to go into alpha at a VERY late stage and with bots included
