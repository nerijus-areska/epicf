EpicF Area page plan and progress

- Main concepts
	- Area has a tree-like map, where each single place has a link to 1-3 other places - they can also come back together
	- I expect to have it all in code, so lookup godot game for references. That's already done there
	- Actualy godot game has a ton of stuff, which will be useful. Damage calculations, armor, spells, etc..
	- 

Few things to consider:
	- I'm ok with having every area defined separately in code in a dictionary or a class based structure
	- BUT, that's not enough, because I want to allow users to explore the areas, so the exploration state needs to be persisted ( it can just be some json in a DB field)
	- One major feature, is that while the structure of 'rooms' will always remain constant, monsters will be generated for each user ( and regenerated at some points )
	- so each room would have an area tier. Or better, multiple tiers represented with percentages, like: (tier2:80%, tier3:20%). I doubt there would be a need for more than two
	
	- so each user would have a different area also with different exploration state. These factors could make even harder areas easier and more profitable


First things to do:
	
	- create some basic structures, think about monster generation and exploration
	- try to draw some of that in Web
	- We aim for a gameplay, where a player is able to navigate rooms, without fighting the monsters. The map should update
